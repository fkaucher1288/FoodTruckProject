# Food Truck Project

# In this project I built a food truck rating app. The user has to option to enter up to 5 food trucks and information about them in the app (name, foodtype, rating). Once the user has entered the info for the food trucks they want to rate, another menu populates that asks the user if they would like to see the list of trucks, the average rating of the trucks, the highest rated truck, or an option to quit the program. This is the first time I have made use of calling different methods to structure the program. It was very challenging, but I learned a good deal about for loops, arrays, and constructors with this project.
